Here’s a technical version of the Deus Vault business plan, reframing each section with more precision, architectural clarity, and implementation detail while preserving the strategic content.

🧠 Deus Vault – Technical Business Plan
1. Overview: What Is Deus Vault?
Deus Vault is a full-stack AI agent infrastructure platform combining:
* A cloud-native orchestration layer for deploying, managing, and scaling autonomous AI agents (microservices that perform complex tasks).

* A verifiable compute backend that abstracts GPU provisioning and usage through HTS-based NFT “Compute Passes.”

* An extensible agent marketplace where developers and enterprises can publish and monetize verticalized AI agents (e.g. marketing analytics, code generation, synthetic test users, etc.).

Agents run on a zero-install, browser-native interface powered by a WebSocket-based frontend, with task orchestration handled through a HCS-sequenced, permissioned compute pipeline on Hedera.

2. Architecture: Open vs Closed Components
Component
	Access Policy
	Rationale
	SDK + CLI (Agent Tooling)
	Open-source (Apache-2)
	Encourages adoption and fast experimentation.
	Local DevBox (Offline VM)
	Open-source (Apache-2)
	Facilitates dev onboarding without cloud spend.
	Core Orchestrator (DV OS)
	Closed-source SaaS
	Revenue moat and protection against hyperscaler cloning.
	Compute Scheduler (GPU)
	Proprietary, closed API
	Manages token-gated usage and dynamic workload allocation.
	Premium Add-ons
	SaaS tiered
	Enterprise support: audit logs, SSO, analytics.
	DV OS runs in a secure cloud enclave (initially AWS + dedicated H100 rack), exposing hardened APIs for agent lifecycle ops (init, call, persist, kill) via gRPC and REST.

3. Revenue Model
Stream
	Description
	Unit Economics
	Pro Subscription
	Monthly fee for advanced features and support.
	$49/user/month
	GPU Passes
	Tokenized compute credits (~$2.50/hour); enforced at runtime.
	~70% gross margin (owned rack)
	Marketplace Fees
	20% cut of agent sales, enforced via smart contract.
	Scalable based on dev adoption
	Enterprise Plan
	Annual flat-rate contract. Includes SSO, uptime SLA, support.
	Starting ~$12K/year
	HTS NFT-based “GPU Passes” gate access to compute endpoints. Agents that invoke inference endpoints must burn or escrow tickets for execution.

4. Go-To-Market & Open Source Release Strategy
Phase
	KPI Milestone
	Next Step
	Private Alpha
	10 partner deployments
	Collect feedback, improve scheduler + DevBox
	Public Beta
	5K active agents, $100K ARR
	Invite 20 dev teams, controlled launch
	SDK Launch
	50K downloads, $1M GMV on agent sales
	Open SDK + sandbox, push docs/tutorials
	Ecosystem Growth
	200+ agents live, regular hackathons
	Incentivize external devs with grants + events
	Release timing for SDKs and sandbox will be gated by verified traction data. SDKs include scaffolding, state-management templates, and agent deployment boilerplate.

5. Moats & Defensibility
Enforcement Mechanisms:
   * Copyleft Runtime License – Modified versions must be contributed upstream or require a commercial license.

   * GPU Pass Tokenization – All meaningful compute is ticketed via HTS NFT; unauthorized mirrors lack compute access.

   * Audit & Integrity – SOC 2 Type II, public metrics, daily runtime checks, bug bounties.

Note: The platform avoids public GPU RPCs—access is scoped to agent runtime environments only, enforcing closed-loop billing.

6. Pricing Structure
User Type
	Pricing Model
	Features Included
	Hobbyist
	Free + pay-as-you-go compute
	Sandbox access + $25 = ~10 GPU-hours
	Pro Developer
	$49/month + compute packs
	Priority queue, agent listing, faster logs
	Enterprise
	Custom contract
	SLA, SSO, audit logs, dedicated support
	Pricing page dynamically tracks GPU spot rates and availability. NFT compute passes display time-to-burn stats for transparency.

7. Core Team Composition
Role
	Description
	CTO
	Core DV OS architect; designs private orchestration layer
	Full-Stack Engineer
	Web UI (Next.js), API integration, usage graph UX
	GPU / DevOps
	Manages H100 rack, Terraform infra, job runner scaling
	Blockchain Engineer
	HTS smart contracts for compute pass mint/burn
	DevRel / Docs
	Maintains tutorials, supports Discord, runs hackathons
	Product/Growth
	Funnels feedback → roadmap, experiments with pricing
	(Future) Front/Backend
	To scale as ARR increases
	(Future) Support Eng.
	Triage bugs and helpdesk ops as daily MAU grows
	Initial team of 6 can operate lean via automation-first principles: GitHub Actions, CI/CD, Terraform, and k8s job batching.

8. First-Year Budget
Category
	Annual Cost (Est.)
	Core Team Payroll (6 FTE)
	$1.07M
	Legal + Audit
	$120K

9. User Commitments
      * Open Developer Onboarding: SDKs, CLI tools, and local DevBox are open under Apache-2.

      * Verifiable Compute Pipeline: All agent compute logs and billing events are hashed to Hedera Consensus Service.

      * No Vendor Lock-in on SDK: Once released, developer tools remain open-source indefinitely.

________________


10. Strategic Moats
         * Fast Time-to-Value: Free DevBox, clear pricing, one-click agent deploy.

         * Token-Gated Compute Access: Only burnable NFT tickets unlock core APIs.

         * Diversified Revenue: ARR from subs, GMV from marketplace, enterprise MRR.

         * Community Flywheel: Docs-a-thons, grant programs, and hackathons build momentum.
