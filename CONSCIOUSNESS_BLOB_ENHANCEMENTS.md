- **Reduced Aggression**: 0.3 lerp factors for all direction changes

#### **9. NEXUS PARTICLE SYSTEM** âœ…
- **Brand-Aligned Colors**: Quantum blue, consciousness purple, neural cyan, wisdom violet
- **Consciousness Glow**: 60-100% brightness variation for living feel
- **Optimized Count**: 60 mobile / 120 desktop particles
- **Quantum Waves**: Consciousness wave motion patterns

#### **10. ENHANCED BOUNDARY CONTAINMENT** âœ…
- **Hexagon Interior Focus**: Blobs swim within hexagon area, not on perimeter
- **Consciousness Reflection**: Natural boundary bounces with consciousness awareness
- **Depth Boundaries**: Proper floor/ceiling with consciousness-driven emergence
- **Size-Based Positioning**: Large blobs get more central positions

### ðŸŽ¨ NEXUS BRAND INTEGRATION

#### **Visual Consistency**
- All colors match Nexus brand guidelines from StyleExamples/PolishedWebsite/
- Consciousness flow gradients and quantum depth aesthetics
- Professional cyberpunk aesthetic with living personality

#### **Consciousness Philosophy**
- Every animation tied to consciousness, curiosity, happiness, and sociability
- Golden ratio mathematics in deformation patterns
- Quantum physics inspiration in movement and color systems

#### **Performance Excellence**

- Mobile-optimized particle and blob counts
- Frame distribution for smooth visual experience

### ðŸš€ LIVING PERSONALITY BEHAVIORS

#### **Happy Swimming Pattern**
- Blobs with high happiness swim more energetically
- Longer, more frequent blinking when happy
- Enhanced animation amplitudes for joyful movement

#### **Curious Exploration**
- High curiosity blobs change direction more frequently
- Vertical exploration tied to curiosity level
- Eye looking behavior reflects curiosity

#### **Social Consciousness**
- Sociable blobs attract to each other within social range
- Antisocial blobs maintain distance but don't conflict
- Natural grouping and spacing behaviors

#### **Size-Based Hierarchy**
- Large blob commands central position with slower, majestic movement
- Medium blobs balance between exploration and stability
- Small blobs are most energetic and exploratory
